<h4>Name: Still things about it.... </h4>

<h5>QUESTION 1 </h5>
<h2> What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h2>
<span><p>My starting topic is the holidays and bring happiness via a online environment. My starting topic is of importance to me because the holidays is normally a
  happy time of the year that brings everyone together.
 <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">It is a time where everyone should put there difference aside and enjoy some good quality time with loved ones.
    It is the one time of year that where people can go all out and show their love for the festive times and should not care about what other people think.
  In other words it is supposed to be the most wonderful time of the year. I want to showcase that happiness through this final project via an online database advent calendar.
The calendar is basically (almost) everything that someone would experience in real life but thought the internet.
Every door has something surrounding the holiday happiness behind it weather it is a movie, song or christmas food recipes etc.
It is important to make this topic an exploriable networked space because it can give someone who doesn't have the opportunity to spend it when anyone; a piece of what christmas happiness is.
his project also adds the element of surprise when you open the doors and find something new each day. That along can being make someone happy. </span></p>

<h5>QUESTION 2 </h5>
<h2>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this “space”. How can you use this “space” to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves,
  their environment and society?</h2>
<span><p>The type of relationship I wish that the users will have with this holiday space is a sense of happiness, joy and start to feel in the mood for the festive times.
  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Every door of the advent calendar will be a different aspect of what the holiday season is all about and with this element
    hopefully it will bring a bit of joy to those who do not feel like they are in a joyful environment during the time of year that is supposed to be quite happy.
  This advent calendar will bring the holiday spirit right at your fingertips, literally via the internet.
This environment will help the users reflect on what they might consider happiness to be to them and if one user has a good relationship with this space,
 they might share the advent calendar with other people and so forth so other can feel the same happiness.
By sharing the calendar with other people they can than experience their own relationship with the space and have their own certain feeling towards the space as well.
Having a space like this it can make people reflect on what is most important during the holidays and that is to be surrounded with good energy and reflect on what is truly important in life because.
If there is one time a year where everyone should be feeling any kind of happiness and joy, that should be during the holiday season. </span></p>

<h5>QUESTION 3 </h5>
<h2>Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your “space” help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h2>
<span><p>When it comes to the notion of empowerment, I think that my space will help people on different levels.
  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">My space can help someone by changing their mood. If someone is having a off day and when they use the advent calendar,
    it can hopefully shift their mood into a somewhat happy mood (at the end of the day it's not going to bring that much happiness
    in reality but it can put a smile on your face and that smile can change someone mood).
  The space can also enable collaboration by helping to bring people together by sharing the calendar. By sharing the advent calendar with other people,
  it will get more people that might develop a relationship with the space and the space might help, challenge etc more people. The ways my space can challenge some people is, it is
   quite possible people might not know what something behind a door actually is and it might be challenging for them to figure out what it is but they can always ask people if they dont
   know what it is and by asking someone that can help bring new people to the advent calender. I also plan on having a database that will generate holiday recipes and someone might
   possibly find the way to make the recipe challenging. The space can also teach someone something new from behind the doors.
 You never know, someone might not know all the christmas traditional or aspect, for example they might not know a recipe or a song or a movie (I plan on making a game,
  holiday songs and movies database list as well) and with this space they can expand their knowledge of the holidays. It is always good to learn something new. </span></p>

<h5>Research and give a brief summary of at least 3 similar projects </h5>
<h2>Example #1 <a href="https://www.jacquielawson.com/advent">Click here for example</a></h2>
<span><p>This project is a online advent calendar created by a Illustrator named Jacquie Lawson.
  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">A user would have to pay for this advent calendar. It is as much as a coffee and even less if you buy more than one.
  The calendar is compatible with PC, Mac, phone and iPad. Lawson makes the calendar for users to enjoy during December.
This space is for all ages. This calendar is literally a animated virtual Christmas village where there is shops,
people walking around with their family and even a snowman in the middle of the village and everyday the village get more and more ready for Christmas.
 The village is decorated with Christmas light, a big tree in the middle of the village.
Snow is always falling down on the village. You can even see the style and space of every snowflake falling.
A user can spend hours exploring what the calendar has to offer. There is also hidden surprises around the village.
Every day there will be a different door to open that will be Christmas related, like a game, a puzzle, a animated Christmas story.
 A pop up will pop up with the number 1 to 25 on it and all the uses has to do is click on the door that corresponds to the day for a new activity  to do in the village.
A user can also design digital snowflakes, play some games that look like a the game you will see on FaceBook, where you have to match the same color gems to level up.
(All Christmas related of course) There is also a room where users can go and have a virtual relaxation section in front of a fire in a cozy room with sofas and books.</span></p>
